Erlang file monitoring service

The behaviour of this service is inspired by the open source FAM daemon
([http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/]). It allows file system paths to be
monitored, so that a message will be sent to the client process whenever a
status change is detected. Currently, the only supported method of detection
is by regular polling by the server.
